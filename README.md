# SDL2-Cpp-Roguelike

This was my entry to r/roguelikedev's summer 2020 code-along. This project was my first foray into c++ and as such, the code could be better. I'm leaving it up to ensure it's available 
as it's hyperlinked in the r/roguelikedev's catalogue of code-along entires. 

A slightly more developed version I worked on after the code-along can be found [here](https://github.com/CGirdlestone/Roguelike). I learnt a lot over the course of the code-along which 
has resulted in my deciding that the best course of action was to undertake a complete refactor from the ground up which is currently ongoing.
